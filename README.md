# Python-Projects
These are my python projects - mainly from school as unfortunately for me I didn't keep many of my homemade projects.

I'm self taught in python. I started learning when I was given my first laptop. I became even more interested when I received a Raspberry Pi - I wanted to write a software that let me connect to it uses another python program on my laptop (TCP)

## Note
These projects were mainly developed before moving onto my University course where I learnt about code commenting and formatting. Even though I'm taught in Java, Haskell and prolog in University I know I can transfer the things I've learnt using them to python.
