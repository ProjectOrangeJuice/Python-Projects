# A level Python program (2017)

For this course work I had to create my own "problem" to solve by pretending to be the client. In this project I wrote out requirements, documentation and manual tests


## Skills

I'd grown confident in my python skills so I decided to try something new for this course work. I decided to use GTK. Previously I had use Tkinter which I found difficult to manage for multiple windows.

I had also started to use classes (the handler) but In this project I would have broken things up more. Nearer the end of this course work I had realised I could have cut a large portion if I used classes.
